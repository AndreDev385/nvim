--- See [docs](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/configuration.html) for extra settings. The settings can be used like this:
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('rust_analyzer', {
---   settings = {
---     ['rust-analyzer'] = {
---       diagnostics = {
---         enable = false;
---       }
---     }
---   }
--- })
--- ```
---
--- Note: do not set `init_options` for this LS config, it will be automatically populated by the contents of settings["rust-analyzer"] per
--- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/eb5da56d839ae0a9e9f50774fa3eb78eb0964550/docs/dev/lsp-extensions.md?plain=1#L26.

return {
	settings = {
		["rust-analyzer"] = {
			diagnostics = {
				enable = false,
			},
			cargo = {
				features = "all",
			},
			checkOnSave = {
				enable = true,

			check = {

			imports = {
